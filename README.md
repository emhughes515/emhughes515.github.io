2. This is my GitHub account for my CTI 110 class. I am able to log into it on either Github on the web or Github desktop to access my repositories.
3. This repository stores my project on Github.com. It currently has a README.md file. I cloned it to my local computer.
4. I created the repository in Github first. In Github Desktop, I logged in with my Github account and chose to clone a repository from the internet. I chose the repository I had created and selected the folder where it should be cloned.
